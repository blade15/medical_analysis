# Medical Data Visualizer

This notebook analyzes medical data to uncover patterns related to cardiovascular health. It preprocesses the dataset, normalizes values, and visualizes relationships between health indicators.

## 📊 Key Tasks

- BMI calculation and obesity flagging
- Normalization of health indicators (`cholesterol`, `gluc`)
- Creation of:
  - A **categorical plot** for comparison by `cardio` status
  - A **correlation heatmap** to assess feature relationships

## 📁 Dataset

Dataset used: `medical_examination.csv`

Ensure the dataset is in the same folder or update the path in the notebook.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Instructions

1. Open the notebook `medical_analysis_notebook.ipynb`.
2. Ensure the dataset file is present.
3. Run all cells to generate visualizations and insights.

## 📈 Output

- Count plot of health features by cardiovascular condition
- Heatmap of feature correlations
